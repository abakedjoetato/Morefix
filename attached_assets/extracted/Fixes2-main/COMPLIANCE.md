| R4 | Implement proper error handling | ✓ Compliant | Comprehensive error handling in `cogs/error_handling_cog.py` with telemetry in `utils/error_telemetry.py` |
| R5 | Provide user-friendly feedback | ✓ Compliant | User feedback system in `utils/user_feedback.py` with suggestion generation and error resolution guides |
| R6 | Implement secure handling of credentials | ✓ Compliant | Secure credential handling in SFTP connection pool with encrypted storage |
| R7 | Maintain data consistency | ✓ Compliant | Database operations use transactions and validation; migrations maintain data integrity |
| R8 | Support both premium and free tiers | ✓ Compliant | Premium features detected via `premium_config.py`; free tier functionality preserved |
| R9 | Scale efficiently with increased usage | ✓ Compliant | Connection pooling, async operations, and efficient database queries implemented |
| R10 | Implement comprehensive testing | ✓ Compliant | Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests created in `tests/` directory |

## SFTP Integration Compliance

The SFTP integration has been thoroughly tested and verified against the following requirements:

1. ✓ **Connection Security**: All connections use SSH keypair or password authentication with secure handling
2. ✓ **Connection Pooling**: Implemented in `utils/sftp_connection_pool.py` with proper resource management
3. ✓ **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors
4. ✓ **Multi-Guild Support**: Each guild has isolated SFTP configuration and connections
5. ✓ **File Handling**: Secure file transfer with integrity verification
6. ✓ **Command Interface**: User-friendly commands with appropriate permission checks

## Error Telemetry Compliance

The error telemetry system complies with all requirements:

1. ✓ **Error Tracking**: All errors captured with context in `utils/error_telemetry.py`
2. ✓ **Error Categorization**: Errors properly categorized for analysis
3. ✓ **Admin Interface**: Error dashboard available via `/debug` command
4. ✓ **Privacy**: PII is properly scrubbed from error reports
5. ✓ **Analytics**: Error pattern detection implemented for common issues
6. ✓ **User Feedback**: Actionable error messages provided to users

## Backward Compatibility Verification

The backward compatibility layer has been tested against previous versions:

1. ✓ **Command API**: All previous command signatures still function
2. ✓ **Extension API**: Third-party extensions continue to work
3. ✓ **Event Handlers**: All event handlers maintain expected behavior
4. ✓ **Data Format**: Data migrations preserve all existing data
5. ✓ **Response Format**: User-visible responses maintain consistent formatting
